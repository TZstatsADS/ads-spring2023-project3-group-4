### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals.

Project 3

Team members: Jiajun DU, Linda LIN, Xiaoxue REN, Jiahao WEI, Aubrey YAN, Hongyan ZHOU

Summary: In this project, we developed several models and ultimately improved the classification accuracy for images to 81%

[Contribution Statement] 

Jiajun Du:
I made a model of model 1 using xgboost classifierfrom, and improved model 1 after discussing with the team members.  The accuracy of my initial model 1 is 0.1612.  With the improvement, the accuracy of model 1 was increased to 0.51.

Linda Lin:
Constructed a reset50 model, which initially did not perform well. However, after making numerous modifications, it now takes about 10 minutes to evaluate the noisy labels and has achieved an accuracy of 0.34 for model 1. I also assisted other team members in testing the code for our final main.ipynb.

Xiaoxue Ren:
Assisted other team members in building CNN model. Improved the accuracy and speed of model 1. Build model 2 and shortened the speed of model 2 by modifying layers of model 2.

Jiahao Wei:
Made a model of model one using NN and SVM and tried weakly supervised learning model in Model2 following the article but changed the sigmoid to softmax since one image only corresponds to one label, however this model performed not as well as semi-supervised learing in this project.
Prepared the speech for presentation.  

Aubrey Yan:
I revised and refined the models developed by my group members such that the accuracy and speed of the models were improved. Additionally, I took the initiative to schedule regular meetings to ensure effective communication and collaboration within the team.


Hongyan Zhou: 
Constructed and trained model 1 and model 2 using CNN. Used model 1 and model 2 to predict labels and calculate accuracy. Effectively shortened the training and prediction time by continuously modifying parameters and changing methods. Improved the accuracy of model 1 to 0.51 and model 2 to 0.81.
