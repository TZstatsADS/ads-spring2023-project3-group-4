### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals.

Project 3

Team members: Jiajun DU, Linda LIN, Xiaoxue REN, Jiahao WEI, Aubrey YAN, Hongyan ZHOU

Summary: In this project, we developed several models and ultimately improved the classification accuracy for images to 81%

[Contribution Statement] 

Hongyan Zhou: 

Constructed and trained model 1 and model 2. Used model 1 and model 2 to predict labels and calculate accuracy. Effectively shortened the training and prediction time by continuously modifying parameters and changing methods. Improved the accuracy of model 1 to 0.51 and model 2 to 0.81.

Jiajun Du:

I made a model of model 1 using xgboost classifierfrom, and improved model 1 after discussing with the team members.  The accuracy of my initial model 1 is 0.1612.  With the improvement, the accuracy of model 1 was increased to 0.51.

Jiahao Wei:
Made a model of model one using NN and SVM and tried weakly supervised learning model in Model2 following the article but changed the sigmoid to softmax since one image only corresponds to one label, however this model performed not as well as semi-supervised learing in this project.
Prepared the speech for presentation.
